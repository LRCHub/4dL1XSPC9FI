```lrc
[00:03.30] This is the story of an ordinary man
[00:05.18] He's a quiet man who seeks no glory
[00:08.11] But he's not afraid to defend what he loves
[00:12.99] He is a simple man, who knows only that
[00:16.36] Loyalty, honesty, and truth mean everything
[00:19.94] This is the story of a hero
[00:33.44] 
[01:14.60] She is the last of her kind
[01:16.50] The descendant of an ancient line of women
[01:19.44] Who commanded reverence, obedience, and love
[01:27.30] But only when he faces the dark secret within his own heart
[01:29.86] Can he grow to the man
[01:32.29] Who has been chosen
[01:41.79] 
[02:27.57] I think there's a reason I'm a shadow
[02:30.60] But she looks like an angel
[02:33.34] What's your name, pretty boy?
[02:35.20] Which way do you think we should go?
[02:53.20] 
[03:38.02] Her shadow, an endless night, falls on the land
[03:41.80] One man must undertake an expedition, an ancient treasure
[03:48.41] But the fire that brings the light can also burn the soul
[03:54.43] The only companion that you can trust is courage
